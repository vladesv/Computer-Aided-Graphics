# Computer AidedG raphics (MATLAB)

This repository contains my laboratory work for the **Computer Aided Graphics** course. The experiments, simulations, and visualizations are implemented in **MATLAB**.

Each folder contains the MATLAB scripts/functions used to solve that lab’s tasks (computations + plots/visualizations).
